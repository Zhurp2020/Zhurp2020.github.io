### 解析
1. 错选B  
   rob发生在过去，要用现完
2. 错选B    
   [网上说](https://hinative.com/en-US/questions/4647845)没有no other than这个表达，有none other than
3. 错选C  
   C是people的后置定语
4. 答案说因为题干里有fact所以是客观事实，要用can't。个人感觉这个太钻牛角尖
5. 错选A  
   [under the pretence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/under%2Fon%20the%20pretense%20of): using as a false reason or explanation (something that is used to hide the real purpose of something) e.g. He called her under the pretense of asking about the homework assignment.
6. 错选B  
   Anyone and everyone要用单数形式，more than one也要用单数形式
7. 错选B  
   [would just as soon do as](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/would-just-as-soon): prefer to do it rather than something else that is possible, e.g. Would you like to go out for dinner?" "I'd just as soon stay in - I'm not feeling very well."
8. 错选C   
   [pull through](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pull%20through): to survive a dangerous or difficult situation, e.g. Initially, there was hope that Murphy would pull through since the 1-year-old dog responded to treatments when Maisy did not.
9. 错选C   
    [feasible](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/feasible): capable of being done, effected, or accomplished, e.g. That is not even very feasible in some areas of the world that have limited electricity supply.  
    [practicable](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/practicable): capable of being done, effected, or put into practice, with the available means, e.g. But what might have been very practicable for eight hundred and sixty men, was impossible for three hundred and sixty.  
    feasible确实比practical要好，但我认为practicable也完全正确。


终于完事了
