### 解答 
1. 错选了A。  
   must have done只能用于肯定推测。
2. 错选了A。  
   of no avail, 韦氏词典的[解释](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/of%20no%20avail)是: not helpful. e.g. Our best efforts were of no avail.  
   of no consequence, collins里的[解释](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/of-consequence)是: not important or valuable. 同时也有of consequence. e.g. Where he is from is of no consequence to me.  
   没有of no ground, 但是[有](https://ludwig.guru/s/has+no+grounds): have no ground, e.g. Therefore, they said, the city has no grounds for a claim.  
3. 显然四个都能填。在Ludwig上四个词组都能找到例句,[active](https://ludwig.guru/s/active+city), [dynamic](https://ludwig.guru/s/dynamic+city), [energetic](https://ludwig.guru/s/energetic+city), [vigorous](https://ludwig.guru/s/vigorous+city)。dynamic和vigorous的[区别](https://wikidiff.com/vigorous/dynamic): dynamic is changing; active; in motion while vigorous is physically strong and active。从上下文来看embracing和has become确实有一种动态的含义，dynamic是最好的选项。
4. 错选了D。  
   [amend](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/amend)的意思是to make better, 用在法案，提议之类的比较多，e.g. The bill would amend Section 230 to give larger platforms just 24 hours to remove content determined by a court to be unlawful.  
   [rectify](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/rectify)的解释：to make, put, or set right; remedy; correct. e.g. So in a joint declaration issued Monday, the EU countries said they would set up an industrial alliance to rectify the situation.
5. 错选了A。  
   问题在于[chaos](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/chaos)和[disorder](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/disorder)都是不可数的。但[mess](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/mess)是可数的，而且常用单数形式in a mess. 
6. 错选了C  
   注意到后半句是一个完整的句子且没有连词，这是个独立主格结构。
7. 这就离谱，显然是个错题。
8. 错选了C  
   C确实很诡异，但也是对的  
   both sons/both of the sons
9. 错选了A  
    [obliging](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/mess): willing or eager to do favors. e.g. At the three-hour-mark, the hitherto obliging Lanzmann finally becomes irritated.  
10. 错选了B  
    [blow one's own trumpet](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/blow-your-own-trumpet-horn): to tell everyone proudly about your achievements. e.g. He had a very successful year and has every right to blow his own trumpet.  
    [bugle](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bugle) 军号，[flute](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/flute)笛
11. 错选了A  
    [excessive](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/excessive)有贬义，going beyond the usual, necessary, or proper limit or degree. e.g. In more than 30 cities demonstrators clashed with police, who responded to their marches with excessive violence.  
    [exceeding](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/exceeding): extraordinary; exceptional. e.g. Would Hodson, knowing the exceeding importance of his mission, have turned to rescue a servant or raise a fallen horse?
12. 错选了B  
    又是一个很诡异的题。degree应该比diploma要高级一点。为什么不是a master/bachelor/...'s degree in X？
